This is to provide some documentation/standardization on the format to be used for compiling hack data as CSVs.
You can always reference existing spreadsheets for an idea for the layout, but for particular details, defer to here, going forward.

The standard fields to be included are: 
Name (there is a regex used to search it is okay to keep punctuation and other symbols if applicable)
Class (base class of the unit)
Affinity (copy-paste the emoji codes for this, reference other spreadsheets)
Portrait (should be a url for a discord embed, we'll be using them for image hosting for the time being)
Lv (base level)
Base Stats
Base Weapon Ranks
Growths
Promoted Class Name
Promotion Stat Gains/Weapon Rank Gains

For the standard stats, use these abbrevations for column names for base values/growths/promo gains/etc:
HP, Str, Mag, Atk (if there is no split), Skl, Spd, Lck, Def, Res, Con, and Mov. 
If the stat is renamed in the hack, such as Dex for Skl, you may use that name instead.

For base weapon ranks, they should be the letter value (ex: D), or an increment above the letter value (ex: C+10).
If a unit does not have a rank in that weapon type, write None (NOT NoRank). The same goes if they do not gain in that rank on promotion.

If a unit does not promote, simply leave the Promotion Class field blank. We will not be using the "Promotes" field or similar such fields
going forward.

For stat gains on promo, if all promo gains for the hack are non-negative, you may simply enter the value (so just "4"), for example.
If not, please make a note of this while submitting, and use positive and negative signs ("+4", or "-3")

For weapon rank gains on promotion, include the + sign for numerical gains (so it should be either a letter like "D", or something like "+40").
